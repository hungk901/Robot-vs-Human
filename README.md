# Robot v.s Human

"Human vs Robot" is a hide and seek game. This game describes a future that human beings start making "not so smart" AI robots because they believe that robots will dominate the world if they are too intelligent. However, a robot evolves itself and figures out human's plan, and it thinks that humans are too dumb to rule the world. In order to take over and make this place better than ever, the first thing this robot has to do is to escape from surveillance. On other hand, human scientists find out the abnormality of the robot, so they decide to destroy it before it runs away.
